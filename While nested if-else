/* Create a program that allows a user to login to their bank account if they enter their 
personal identification number (PIN). Their PIN is a 4 digit number with a value of 1234. 
If the user enters the incorrect value for the PIN they will be given an error message and 
asked to enter their PIN again. The program will continue to prompt the user for their PIN 
until the user enters the correct value or until they have tried three times. If the user is 
successful in the first three attempts they should be given a message informing them that they 
have successfully accessed their account. After three failed attempts, the user should be informed 
that they will not be able to access their account because the user is only given three chances to 
enter their PIN. 
1. Ask user for PIN (4 digit: 1234)
2. Give error message if it is incorrect, ask to re-enter PIN until it is correct or tried three times
3. if user is successful in first three attempts, give message they successful accessed the account
4. if failed three attempts, inform user they will have no access to the account because given three chances
