/* Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in reverse binary. 
For an integer x, the algorithm is: 

 As long as x is greater than 0
 Output x % 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
 x = x / 2
       
Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order. 

INPUT: 6
OUTPUT: 011 */
