/* Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input, and outputs the max and average. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics. Assume the input contains at least one non-negative integer.

Output the average with two digits after the decimal point followed by a newline, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.2f\n", average);

INPUT: 15 20 0 3 -1
OUTPUT: 20 9.50
